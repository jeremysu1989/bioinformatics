## Introduction
to use the Python programming language to facilitate and automate the wide variety of data manipulation tasks encountered in life science research and development.
#### about bioinformatics
- *computaional biology*
- *Software development*
- *Life science research and development*

the book focuses on particular data management and manipulation tasks.

broadly speaking, programming languages embody combinations of four paradigms.
- procedural
- declarative
- functional
- object oriented

## primitives
**type** and **value**  *vs* **class** and **object**

### simple values
logical(Boolean), integer, float, and string

#### expressions
an *operator* is a symbol that indicates a calculation usng one or more operands. The combination of the operator and its operand is an expression
- numeriac operators
- logical operations      
  six comparison operators ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
- string operations
  four binary operators that act on strings: **in, not in, + and * **, and
