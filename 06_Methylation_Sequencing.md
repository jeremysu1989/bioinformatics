##Analysing bisulfite methylation sequencing data

---

### Bisulfite-Seq theory and Quality Control

#### Distribution of CG
路 CpG dinuleotides are not evenly distributed
路 Most occurwithin high density regions called CpG Islands

路 Most of the genome contains methylated CpGs
路 CpGs in CpG islands are largely unmethylated
