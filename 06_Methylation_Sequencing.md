## Analysing bisulfite methylation sequencing data

---

### Bisulfite-Seq theory and Quality Control

#### Distribution of CG
- CpG dinuleotides are not evenly distributed
- Most occurwithin high density regions called CpG Islands

- Most of the genome contains methylated CpGs
- CpGs in CpG islands are largely unmethylated
