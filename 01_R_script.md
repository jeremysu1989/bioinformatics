## R basic
### Everything in R is an object
#### R has 6 basic data types. (In addition to the five listed below, there is also raw which will not be discussed in this workshop.)

1 character

2 numeric (real or decimal)

3 integer

4 logical

5 complex

#### R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example

class() - what kind of object is it (high-level)?

typeof() - what is the objectâ€™s data type (low-level)?

length() - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?

attributes() - does it have any metadata?

#### R has many data structures. These include

atomic vector

list

matrix

data frame

factors
