Nucleotide and protein sequences are stored in two plain-text formats widespread in bioinformatics:**FASTA** and **FASTQ**.

Simple mistakes over minor details like file formats can consume a disproportionate amount of time and energy to discover and fix, so mind these details early on.

#### The FASTA Format
The FASTA format is used to store any sort of sequence data not requiring per-base pair quality scores. This includes reference genome files, protein sequences, coding DNA sequences (CDS), transcript sequences, and so on.

**FASTA** files are composed of sequence entries, each containing two parts: a description and the sequence data.
